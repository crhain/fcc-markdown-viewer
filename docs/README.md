FREECODECAMP MARKDOWN VIEWER
==============================================

This project was created for freeCodeCamp.  A working demo can be found at [http://crhwebdev.github.io/fcc-markdown-viewer](http://crhwebdev.github.io/fcc-markdown-viewer)


Objective
----------------------------------------------

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

* User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

* User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked
